# Python Assignment

## Project Structure

- `./data/` folder with initial and produced data files for Python Assignment.
- `./utils/` package with Python modules, where helper functions & procedures are stored (for data loading, types conversion, features addition, etc.). 
- `data_analysis.ipynb` notebook with initial EDA. Formal staff was checked in order to understand dataset structure. 
Results of EDA could be useful to explain approach and assumption in further feature engineering.
- `feature_engineering.ipynb` processing initial data, addition of features requested with some explanation.
